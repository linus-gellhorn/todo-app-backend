# Academy Express Starter

This is set up as a quick starter for a no-persistence RESTful Express API (using just an array for in-server memory).

## Getting started

### Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Run server

```
yarn start
```

Or, for dev mode (restarts server automatically when relevant files change):

```
yarn start:dev
```

### Heroku app

Access the backend API hosted on Heroku [here](https://todo-app-academy.herokuapp.com/)
